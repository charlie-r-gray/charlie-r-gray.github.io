NEUROPLASTICITY

- The brains ability to change (neuro- brain, neuron. -plasticity: ability to be moulded)
- brain is adaptable (physio, compensation for injury, senses)
- memory, cognition, learning
- brain is always making new connections (muscle memory, recall) and is therefore always capable of learning
- like muscle: reused pathways get stronger, unused pathways get weaker
- dopamine in learning and memory (yeah no shit yaaaaaaay great news wooooooow)
- addiction: speed dm, intensity dm, reliability of dm (leads to tolerance)



DEPRESSION, ANXIETY:
- depression causes damage
- maladaptive pathways are enforces ('stuck in a rut')
- damage recovers due to plasticity with time
On anxiety:
These more permanent brain changes can be achieved through adapting and changing thought patterns, through recall and memory patterning, breathing exercises, eye patterning, modifying postural habits, increasing body awareness, and targeting sensory perception
1 Memory tasks and games;
2 Learning to juggle;
3 Learning to play a new instrument;
4 Learning a new language;
5 Yoga;
6 Mild to moderate regular exercise;
7 Challenging brain activities like crosswords or sudoku;
8 Learning a new subjectâ€”especially a large, complex subject in a short period of time

- 'unlearn' implied limitations
- encourages people to pursue new goals
- engage in challenge rather than treat challenge as a limit
- recovery from TBI

- How to Stop Giving a Fuck: "...challenge as failure, inconvenient as personal slight..."

- embrace challenge
- learn a new skill
- attempt previous failures again
- learning a new language (legitness)

N + ADHD
"Neuroplasticity" wikipedia:
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
MRI studies of 1713 participants shows that both children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have smaller volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, putamen, and overall cortical and intracranial volume; and have less surface area and cortical thickness, compared to people without ADHD.[105][106] Brain volume does not correlate to intelligence, or intelligence quotient (IQ).[107] People with ADHD exhibit atypical neuroconnectivity. In particular, it has been hypothesized that ADHD symptomatology may arise from a deviation from neurotypical synchronization and interaction within and between these large-scale networks during brain development. Investigating functional connectivity using the sub-second temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) instead allows for the measurement of a wider range of brain oscillatory phenomena, including transient changes in connectivity during cognition and behavior.[108]

Reviews of MRI and electroencephalography (EEG) studies on individuals with ADHD suggest that the long-term treatment of ADHD with stimulants, such as amphetamine or methylphenidate, decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia,[109][110][111] left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and superior temporal gyrus.[112]

Growth Mindset is about acknolwedging neuroplasticity
ie learned skills, not innate talents

"My brain can change, therefore I can learn"
"I may not be capable of this now, but one day I may"
