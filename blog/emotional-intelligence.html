          <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
          <h2>An exploration of the many intelligences</h2>
          <hr>


          <h3>The two families of intelligence</h3>
    
    <p>
        There are many <span class=emph-text>different types</span> of intelligences. Many of them we give <span class=emph-text>casual names:</span> 
        'book smart' for those who have retained a lot of information, 
        'MacGyver' if you're adaptable at applying knowledge abstractly, 
        'quick learner' for those who absorb information with minimal exposure, 
        'street smart' for people who make wise choices under pressure, 
        'cunning' for those who can navigate around (or manipulate) other people, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        These many intelligences are distinct and not necessarily equal within a given person - not everybody who knows a lot can necessarily apply a lot, for example - 
        but can be typically grouped into either of two 'families' of intelligence: <span class=emph-text>EQ</span> and <span class=emph-text>IQ</span>.
    </p>

    <h4>EQ: 'Emotional Quotient'</h4>
    <p>
        EQ is a measurement of our <span class=emph-text>emotional intelligence</span> - our understanding of relationships, people, and their psychological needs. 
        EQ measures our ability to <span class=emph-text>recognise and understand emotion</span> - both our own, and others'. 
        Like logical intelligence, this can be used both positively and negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different expressions of emotional intelligence include: street smarts, cunning, likability, subtlety, compassion, consideration, insight, being supportive, 
        'schmoozing', persuasion, PR, soothing, empathy, bereavement, guilt, duty, confidence, teamwork, leadership, determination, 
        and noticing others' change in mood or emotion 
        (such as when your parent or partner has silently become tense or irritable).</p>

    <h4>IQ: 'Intellectual  Quotient'</h4>
    <p>
        IQ, by comparison, is a measurement of our <span class=emph-text>logical intelligence</span> - our understanding of patterns, systems, and physical limitations. 
        IQ measures our ability to <span class=emph-text>think abstractly</span>: predict sequences, retain general knowledge, make connections between data, and estimate possible outcomes of certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p>Different expressions of logical intelligence include: being book smart, a fast learner, improvisation, working memory, 
        information retention, improvising solutions, curiosity, reading comprehension, problem-solving, design, and understanding complex abstract concepts 
        (such as mathematics or astrophysics).</p>
<hr>
    <h3>The relationship between EQ and IQ</h3>
    <p>
        It is a <span class=emph-text>limitation of our language</span> that we use 'intelligence' as a stand-alone word 
        to refer primarily to <span class=emph-text>one singular type</span> of understanding and comprehension - 
        that of patterns and logical concepts.
        The truth is that <span class=emph-text>both families</span> of intelligence - emotional, and logical - 
        require <span class=emph-text>nuanced and abstract thinking</span>. They are both about <span class=emph-text>understanding</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A given person may be <span class=emph-text>excellent with calculating numbers</span>, 
        yet fail to recognise how the comments they make <span class=emph-text>insult and alienate</span> the people around them. 
        Not merely because this person <span class=emph-text>specifically wants</span> to be left alone, a <span class=emph-text>social pariah</span> - 
        but because they genuinely don't understand <span class=emph-text>why they are</span>, 
        even as they estimate the trajectory of their homemade trebuchet.
    </p>

<h4>IQ and EQ in the workplace</h4>

    <p>
        It is unfortunate that those who <span class=emph-text>celebrate their IQ</span> have pushed to a cultural idea that EQ is <span class=emph-text>irrelevant or inferior</span> - 
        ironically while <span class=emph-text>requiring and desiring</span> many of the things inspired by and dependant upon it,
        such as <span class=emph-text>teamwork in the workplace</span>.
        Much as many citizens see fit to mistreat and <span class=emph-text>look down upon</span> the same truckers that deliver their goods,
        the same sanitation workers that empty their bins, the same staff that serve their food - 
        yet would <span class=emph-text>inevitably suffer and complain without them</span>. 
        The conceptual abstract has <span class=emph-text>claimed prestige</span> over <span class=emph-text>their own indispensable foundation</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Familiar with the phrase, "<span class=emph-text>it's not what you know: it's who you know</span>?" Our IQ undeniably affects our success and productivity in our fields, 
        but it is our EQ that determines where we can go, how high we can climb, how fast. 
        <span class=emph-text>Sycophancy</span> may carry the worker further than <span class=emph-text>correcting</span> bosses' sloppy mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A world based on all IQ would be a <span class=emph-text>meritocracy</span>, but our world maintains social hierarchy, and rewards hard work with higher quotas.
        A world based on all EQ would be <span class=emph-text>steeped in nepotism</span>, creating disasters as unqualified friends and family adopt powerful positions.
        Our world often favours EQ, but has always <span class=emph-text>relied on both</span> EQ and IQ - we succeed when we value <span class=emph-text>developing both</span>.
    </p>

<h3>Emotion and EQ in our personal lives</h3>

    <p>
        Our IQ's strength is in general logic. People, however, are <span class=emph-text>much more nuanced</span> than any pattern - 
        and unfortunately, the nature of modern society and it's priority of production has been to mistreat and <span class=emph-text>neglect</span> emotion. 
        When compared to our <span class=emph-text>Thinking Selves</span>, our <span class=emph-text>Emotional Selves</span> are considered weak, irrelevant, inferior. 
        <span class=emph-text>"Emotion is valid, but logic is better."</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Emotion can be seen as almost <span class=emph-text>dirty and inconvenient</span>. Humans are <span class=emph-text>'higher beings'</span>; 
        we treat our ability to think abstractly as a <span class=emph-text>divine, ascendant self</span>, 
        and our emotions as a hold-over from an <span class=emph-text>fraught animal self</span> - 
        one that a truly self-aware person <span class=emph-text>should aspire to ignore</span>. 
        That if ever a person makes a decision in emotion and 'want', and not in logic and 'should' - 
        that <span class=emph-text>they must be weak</span> and slovenly; that a truly worthy person is capable 
        of <span class=emph-text>denying their emotion</span> not just as needed, but <span class=emph-text>all the time</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But this attitude is both incorrect and harmful. Humans are, <span class=emph-text>at their core</span>, emotional. Our emotion communicates our needs and helps us meet them.
    </p>
    <h4>Why humans ARE emotion</h4>
    <p>
        Without emotion, we <span class=emph-text>can't establish values</span> - what is important to us? What inspires our passion, love, fear? 
        Do the needy bring us to feel grief? Does injustice inspire anger? Does obsolescence instill terror?
        And <span class=emph-text>without values</span>, we struggle to make well-reasoned decisions. 
        Why is any choice more valuable than another, if you <span class=emph-text>feel nothing for their outcome</span>? 
        Why do we push ourselves to be more, if there isn't something we <span class=emph-text>desire</span> to become? 
        Something we <span class=emph-text>fear</span> and seek to escape?
    </p>
    <p>
        Brain scans measuring conductively show that humans <span class=emph-text>actually make their choices impulsively</span>, 
        seconds before the conscious self 'thinks' that they do; 
        that their logical self is extrapolating and <span class=emph-text>rationalising</span> what is ultimately an <span class=emph-text>emotional decision</span>. 
        Logic informs us as emotional creatures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ironically, the people who consider themselves to be <span class=emph-text>the most 'rational'</span> are are leaning upon 
        their own <span class=emph-text>emotionally-defined values</span>
         to determine what they believe 'rational' even <span class=emph-text>looks like</span>!
        If you feel like you easily make logical decisions, that you <span class=emph-text>don't struggle</span> with making good choices - that is a sign that
        your Thinking Self has gotten good at telling your Emotional Self what it already wants to hear. 
        Convincing yourself the compelling choice that <span class=emph-text>feels</span> right, always <span class=emph-text>is</span> right.
    </p>

<h4>What this means for us?</h4>

    <p>
        It is a mistake to think that emotion is something we should 'rise above'. 
        Emotion is not our weakness - it is <span class=emph-text>the core</span> of our relationships, teamwork, leadership, understanding. 
        It is fundamental to our success, both as peers, and in the workplace.
        Our <span class=emph-text>attitude towards</span>, and <span class=emph-text>management</span> of, emotion is where our concern should lie. 
        We should seek to recognise, understand and <span class=emph-text>resolve</span> emotion - not deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A smart and educated person will <span class=emph-text>struggle to succeed</span> if they cannot interact with peers in a <span class=emph-text>healthy way</span>. 
        A <span class=emph-text>driven person</span> can exhaust and hurt themselves if they don't take care of their <span class=emph-text>own emotional needs</span>. 
        With emotional intelligence, we can find ourselves with help and support, positive relationships that nonetheless contribute to our success.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can have <span class=emph-text>productive lives</span> without a healthy relationship with emotion, but we <span class=emph-text>cannot have fulfilling ones</span>.
