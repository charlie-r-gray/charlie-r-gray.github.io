            <h1>CSS and Shape Boundaries</h1>

            <h2>Borders, Margins, and Padding</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>What do these three properties have in common?</h3>

            <p>Margin, border, and padding are all ways to <span class=emph-text>define and highlight the boundaries</span>
                 of a shape. Though they can look superficially similar in many conditions, they function separately.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Let's start with border.</h3>

            <p>Border defines <span class=emph-text>the boundary of the shape itself</span> and what it looks like.
                 It highlights the edge in colour, or can define what shape the edge is.</p>

            <h4>How may we use borders?</h4>
            <p>A conventional border has the same thickness in all dimensions, is typically a solid colour,
                 and retains the rectangular shape.</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/base-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Basic border code sample">
              <img src="../images/borders/base-img.png" class=imgpop alt="A picture example of basic borders">


            <h4>On border shapes:</h4>

            <p>We can change the shape of the border by altering its radius, which is defined by its corner.
                 A radius of 50% will see two corners meet in the middle, making a circle:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/circ-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Border code for circles">
              <img src="../images/borders/circ-img.png" class=imgpop alt="Picture example of code output">

            <p>We can use lower percentages to change the shape to a rounded tile, and to keep consistency across
                 multiple shapes. No matter what size we make the shapes, their <span class=emph-text>overall proportions</span>
                 remain the same.</p>
            <p>The following shapes have different sizes, and a border radius of 35%:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/pcent-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Code sample, radius percentage">
              <img src="../images/borders/pcent-img.png" class=imgpop alt="Picture example of border radius with percentage">
            
              <p>But we don't have to use percentages. An absolute number will give us a consistent size to the corner. The shapes individually 
                 may vary, but their boundaries <span class=emph-text>relative to each other</span> are consistent.</p>

            <p>Now see how they are compared when given a set border radius of 50px, instead:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/px-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Code sample, absolute value">
              <img src="../images/borders/px-img.png" class=imgpop alt="Picture example of border radius with absolute value">

            <p>Just keep in mind that if you make your elements smaller (such as if they are using relative size in a mobile display),
                 an absolute border size may reduce the border to a circle once small enough! At 50px border radius, any image 100px
                  or smaller will become a complete circle.</p>
            
            
            <h4>On border sides:</h4>

            <p>We don't have to have a border look the same on all sides. In fact, <span class=emph-text>changing the border on
                 individual sides</span> gives us a great deal of control, and allows us to create more complex shapes through illusory magic!</p>
            <p>I can place a more prominent border on <span class=emph-text>only the top edge</span> to turn this circle into a Voltorb:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/poke-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Code example of single borders">
              <img src="../images/borders/poke-img.png" class=imgpop alt="Voltorb is ignoring you.">

            <p>...though note that the shape needed to be made only half-height to compensate.</p>
            <p>This is because the border exists <span class=emph-text>outside of the shape</span>, and so an uneven border distorted the overall shape as viewed by the user.</p>
            <p>The radius of the border is for <span class=emph-text>the border itself</span>; so if the border is a significantly different shape
                  than the base shape it surrounds, the radius property is off-centre from the shape's 'actual' centre.</p>

            <p>Now let's used what we've learned and make borders of different thickness and colours:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/funk-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="Code example of mismatched border width and colours">
              <img src="../images/borders/funk-img.png" class=imgpop alt="I'm sure I've seen designs like this on a bus seat somewhere.">

            <p>Notice how the transition between the borders' many sides is evenly split, from corner to corner? It's very predictable, and
                 we can abuse that, too.</p>
            <p>The mad thing about that last part is that if we make the border colour <span class="emph-text">transparent</span>, we can
                 create shapes that don't look like boxes at all:</p>
              <img src="../images/borders/tri-cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="code making a triangle out of transparent borders">
              <img src="../images/borders/tri-img.png" class=imgpop alt="a triangle, made entirely out of borders">

            <p>What we have here is a shape with <span class=emph-text>no dimensions</span> (so the border is the only thing visible),
                 <span class=emph-text>no top border</span> (so the side's corners meet the top),
                 <span class=emph-text>a full-height bottom border with colour</span> (the triangle we can actually see), and lastly,
                 <span class=emph-text>transparent sides, half the width of our bottom border</span> (this cuts the triangle shape).</p>
            <p>Once you start layers multiple shapes together, each with their own fills, border colours, and border shapes, you can assemble complex images out of pure CSS!</p>
            <p class="captx">...You know, <span class=emph-text>if you wanted</span>. If masochism was your bread and butter. You could.</p>

                <!--Margins/padding-->

            <hr>
            <h3>Margins and padding.</h3>

            <p>Margins and padding seem to have similar roles at first - they define <span class="emph-text">how much space is around</span>
                 the boundary. Though they define different space, they can be used in similar ways with the same syntax.</p>

            <p><span class=emph-text>Margins</span> define how much space is <span class="emph-text">outside of the boundary</span>.
                 Margin around the shape means the whole shape will retreat from the other elements around it, including the screen.
                  How much gap is there between our cube and the edge of the screen?</p>
            
            <p><span class=emph-text>Padding</span> define how much space is <span class="emph-text">inside of the boundary</span>.
                 Padding around the content of a shape (such as text) means the border will retreat from its contents, based on padding.
                  How much gap is there between our cube's border, and the text content it contains?</p>


            <h4>Let's do some comparisons.</h4>

            <p>First, let's look at some shapes with no margins or padding at all:</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/00cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="0p0m, code sample">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/00img.png" class=imgpop alt="0p0m, img sample">

            <p>In our example, we can't see the yellow box at all, because the red and blue boxes completely fill its bounds.
                 The title 'margin' is also obscured behind the content of the red box. These kids need more space!</p>

            <p>So let's give them a default amount of space, so we can see what we're doing. 10px for each should be enough:</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/1010cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="10p10m, code sample">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/1010img.png" class=imgpop alt="10p10m, code sample">
            <p class="captx">Ahh, much better! It's like I can <span class=emph-text>breathe</span> again.</p>

            <p>That shows you why we need padding and margins, but let's demonstrate why they are different.</p>


            <h4>Juicier padding:</h4>
            
            <p>Remember that <span class=emph-text>padding</span> is responsible for how far a shape's <span class=emph-text>boundary</span>
                 (our border) is from its own <span class=emph-text>contents</span> (our text).</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/205cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="code sample of larger padding">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/205img.png" class=imgpop alt="demonstration of larger padding">


            <h4>Juicier margins:</h4>

            <p>In contrast, our <span class=emph-text>margins</span> are responsible for how far a shape's <span class=emph-text>boundary</span>
                 (our border) is from <span class=emph-text>other content</span> (our red and yellow boxes).</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/520cbn.png" class=imgpop alt="code sample of larger margins">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/520img.png" class=imgpop alt="demonstration of larger margins">


            <h4>Defining spaces</h4>

            <p>By default, padding and margin apply to all sides equally. However, we can apply them to specific sides.
                 Remember that we defining the <span class=emph-text>boundary's space</span>, and not it's position.
                 We add boundary space to the left, and our shape 'appears' to shift right:</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/speccbn.png" class=imgpop alt="code sample of individual boundary properties">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/specimg.png" class=imgpop alt="demonstration of individual boundary properties">

            <p>Or we can define all of them one after another on one line, clockwise from the top:</p>
              <img src="../images/padmarg/clockcbn.png" class=imgpop alt="code sample of clockwise boundary properties">
              <img src="../images/padmarg/clockimg.png" class=imgpop alt="demonstration of clockwise boundary properties">

            <p>The cheeky thing with page elements and how they interact with CSS is that,
                 <span class=emph-text>sometimes</span>, they can look like they're doing the same thing. 
                 And <span class=emph-text>often</span>, the same results can be gained from different areas of CSS. 
                That means sometimes, you don't know if your padding on a container is too large, or the margins on its contents too large; 
                maybe you need to add a padding at the end of your page, or maybe you add a margin to your footer.</p>

            <p>Thus, many of us shall surely go mad, gazing into the stream of <span class=emph-text>.</span>s and 
                <span class=emph-text>#</span>s, the <span class=emph-text>{ }</span> - wondering <span class=emph-text>where it all went wrong</span>.</p>

            <p>Anyway, <span class=emph-text>good luck with that</span>, is what I'm saying.</p>
            <p class="captx">Maybe don't make that incredibly complex image out of CSS, after all.</p>
