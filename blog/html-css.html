        <article><h1>Using CSS - margin, border, and padding</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What do these features have in common?</h2>

<p>Margin, border, and padding are all ways to <span class=emph-text>define and highlight the boundaries</span> of a shape. Though they can look superficially similar in many conditions, they function separately.</p>

<h3>Let's start with border.</h3>

<p>Border defines the boundary of the shape itself and what it looks like. It highlights the edge in colour, or can define what shape the edge is.</p>

<h4>How may we use borders?</h4>
<p>A conventional border has the same thickness in all dimensions, is typically a solid colour, and retains the rectangular shape.</p>
<img src="#">
<h4>On border shapes:</h4>
<p>We can change the shape of the border by altering its radius, which is defined by its corner. A radius of 50% will see two corners meet in the middle, making a circle:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>We can use lower percentages to scale to the shape, or use absolute pixels values to keep consistency across multiple sizes shapes.</p>
<p>The following shapes have different sizes, and a border radius of 25%:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>Now see how they are compared with given a set border radius of 50px, instead:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>We can get consistent looks between images of multiple sizes by using absolute border radius instead. Just keep in mind that if you make your elements smaller (such as if they are using relative size in a mobile display), an absolute border size may reduce the border to a circle once small enough!</p>
<h4>On border sides:</h4>
<p>We don't have to have a border look the same on all sides. In fact, changing the border on individual sides gives us a great deal of control, and allows us to create more complex shapes through illusory magic!</p>
<p>I can place a border on only the top edge to turn this cirle into a Voltorb:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>I can make borders of different thickness and colours:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>The mad thing about that last part is that if we make the border colour <span class="emph-text">transparent</span>, we can create shapes that don't look like boxes at all:</p>
<img src="#">

<h3>Margins and padding.</h3>

<p>Margins and padding seem to have similar roles at first - they define <span class="emph-text">how much space is around</span> the boundary. Though they define different space, they can be used in similar ways with the same syntax.</p>

<h4>Margins:</h4>
<p>Margins define how much space is <span class="emph-text">outside of the boundary</span>. Margin around the shape means the whole shape will retreat from the other elements around it, including the screen. How much gap is there between our cube and the edge of the screen?</p>
<h4>Padding:</h4>
<p>Padding define how much space is <span class="emph-text">inside of the boundary</span>. Padding around the content of a shape (such as text) means the border will retreat from its contents, based on padding. How much gap is there between our cube's border, and the text content it contains?</p>
<h4>Defining spaces</h4>
<p>By default, padding and margin apply to all sides equally. However, we can apply them to specific sides:</p>
<img src="#">
<p>Or we can define all of them one after another on one line, clockwise from the top:</p>
