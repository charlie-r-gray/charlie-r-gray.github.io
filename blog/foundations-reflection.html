          <h3>What core learning has taught me</h3>
          <p>
            Okay, this is not going to be an interesting answer, because the truth is... I was already doing 'core learning', for my own wellness. I started several years ago now, and the version of me that you see is a result of how much progress I've made so far. So doing the core material didn't have a lot to teach me personally, because its goal was to introduce things I happened to already be familiar with.
          </p>
          <h4>I did learn one thing...</h4>
          <p>
            It wasn't part of the Core, but: I was placing too much of my worth in what I produced. Even in 'producing' core content, via the blogs. I would get frustrated, spent hours feeling those feelings but not taking the time to resolve them properly, ranting at my emotional state because 'we don't have time' or 'you're being a goddamn baby', or 'shut the fuck up you diva, I'm trying to work, and you're getting in the way'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, that didn't work. I was never in a position where I decided to quit. But I did reach a point that I broke and was too tired to do anything but let things happen around me. I couldn't produce anything, because I was exhausted; and I hated myself for it, because I was measuring my worth by what I was producing. And it wasn't fair. Emotional work IS WORK. If I spend two hours meditating to address my emotional state, and two hours coding to progress coursework, then I have done four hours of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still have to figure out how to manage the absurd volume of emotional work, though. I'm better than I was, but I suspect I still have more than most. I know now that I clearly can't produce coursework if I neglect emotional work. But there's so MUCH of it, and it takes up so much TIME, and it has to be resolved FIRST, and there isn't the SPACE for that in a structured environment. I can't interrupt a lesson with "excuse me, I'm really feeling it today, can we all postpone this for two hours so I can meditate outside? Thanks."
          </p>

          <h3>Why core learning matters</h3>
          <p>
            We can't solve technical problems while dealing with well-being problems, and core learning teaches us how to handle our well-being. All problems come with an emotional response. Handling our emotional response both helps us emotionally, and makes solving the problems much easier and faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding is highly collaborative. It isn't just sitting in a corner looking at logic loops; you're working with other people. We're better at coding when we know how to do that well. And you'll be working with yourself - it's important to understand your own self, as well. What you can be capable of, where your limits actually are (probably not where you think they are).
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what the core skills is Foundations is seeking to teach you. How to work best with yourself, best with others, and put that best forward in a way that makes working with you a great experience. Not just because you know how to code, but also because you know how to communicate.
