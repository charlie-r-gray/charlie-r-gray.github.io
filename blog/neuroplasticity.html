          <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
          <h2>Adapt, Improvise, Overcome</h2>


          <hr>
        <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
          
          <p>
            'Neuroplasticity' refers to our brain's ability to change, and grow.
            <span class=emph-text>Adapt, improvise, overcome.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We're well aware of the 'use it or lose it' philosophy on musculature.
            You want to dead-lift 100 kilos? Start by dead-lifting 20.
            You want to <span class=emph-text>keep</span> dead-lifting 100 kilos?
            <span class=emph-text>Don't stop.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The same is true of most of the rest our being - <span class=emph-text>physical, emotional, mental.</span>
            The things we use get stronger, easier, to the point we don't think about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socialise, and you get more likable and charming.
            Indulge in anger, and you become more quick-tempered.
            Overeat when young ("there's starving children out there!") and overfeed yourself as an adult.
            For good and bad, the road most traveled wears the deepest - <span class=emph-text>'stuck in a rut'</span>.
            Your brain's proverbial carriage wheels easily slip into the trails of its previous trips.
          </p>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity in trauma and recovery</h3>

          <p>
            This can have its downsides, of course.
            Depression shows physical damage in the brain, as self-abusing thoughts carve deeper and thicker.
            Maladaptive habits designed to help cope short-term take root, and become harder and harder to replace.
          </p>
          <p>
            But <span class=emph-text>there's good news, too</span>: much like the wind wears away old footprints, so too does time fill old forgotten tracks.
            <span class=emph-text>With enough time and effort,</span> the damage from depression can even heal and reverse.
            <span class=emph-text>With enough time and effort,</span> we can replace maladaptive habits with healthy ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a traumatic leg injury, physiotherapy and strengthen you enough to walk again.
            And after a traumatic <span class=emph-text>brain</span> injury, you can relearn to walk, write, and speak with different parts of your brain.
            Like your leg, they just need the time to train.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physiotherapy on a sore leg that has been once broken hurts, it really does. But it doesn't get well enough to unless you walk on it, anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            In physio, we endure physical pain, and we struggle physically - stopped before physical damage, but always pushing our temporary limits. 
            So too in learning do we endure emotional pain, and we struggle emotionally - stopped before burnout, but always pushing our temporary limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans generally rely heavily on sight, but without it, your awareness of other senses is heightened.
            It's not a superpower, to tell where people are in the room feeling their vibrations in the floor,
            or to 'hear' how sound changes shape as it bounces off of them.
            To write smoothly with your lips or your toes in the absence of hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class=emph-text>It's neuroplasticity in action.</span>
          </p>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity in Learning</h3>

          <h4>This is your brain on neuroplasticity.</h4>

          <p>
            Do you still drive today like you did when you had a Learner license?
            Because I'm willing to bet that driving has become <span class=emph-text>autonomous</span> for you;
            that if anything, you sat in the driver's seat wondering about what your day will be like.
            What to have for dinner. What you did yesterday; if you can do better today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, now how confident do you think you'd be <span class=emph-text>flying a commercial plane</span> - right now, today?
            Checking altitude, lift, bearing, fuel lines, understanding each dial - 
            and yet, at one point in your life, imagining driving a car took just as much cognitive effort.
            Now it is intimately familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or maybe driving isn't familiar to you yet - but <span class=emph-text>is biking?</span>
            Do you still consciously think about how you turn slightly to the opposite side just before a tight turn,
            to bring the bike's centrifugal centre under you; how you lean steeply into the turn?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class=emph-text>Is walking?</span> Do you take each step haltingly, checking your balance with every step;
            are you cognisant of 'falling forwards' and catching yourself, over and over? Or is it simply 'walking' to you now?
          </p>

          <h4>What this means for your learning</h4>
          <p>
            The great news is that this neuroplasticity <span class=emph-text>never goes away</span>.
            Even when you're over sixty, it's still there.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a long time we thought that neuroplasticity was a child's skill; that as we aged we just <span class=emph-text>become</span>.
            As smart as we'll be, as cunning as we'll be, as likable as we'll be.
            Children learn so many new words a day, after all - yet adults struggle to learn half as much.
          </p>
          <p>
            But of course children learn faster than adults - they're never doing anything else!
            <span class=emph-text>All they do</span> is learn.
            You can feel annoyed that you're not learning your chosen language as 'effortlessly' as a bilingual child raised in it - 
            but are you dedicating 8+ hours a day to it? No? 
            <span class=emph-text>Then what about a child learning language is effortless?</span>
            Did you master the fork immediately as a toddler? No?
            <span class=emph-text>Then why should you master the chopsticks immediately as an adult?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are always capable of learning, as long as we insist on <span class=emph-text>still trying to learn</span>.
          </p>

          <hr>
          <h3>A Growth Mindset</h3>

          <p>
            The growth mindset is <span class=emph-text>nothing more complex</span> than the recognition,
            and <span class=emph-text>celebration</span>, of neuroplasticity.
            Of 'not yet.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourteen-year-old you doesn't know how to drive... <span class=emph-text>yet.</span><br>
            Five-year-old you doesn't know how to bike... <span class=emph-text>yet.</span><br>
            Two-year-old you doesn't know how to use a knife and fork... <span class=emph-text>yet.</span><br>
            Infant you doesn't know how to walk... <span class=emph-text>yet.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What don't you know how to do... <span class=emph-text>yet?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The great thing about <span class=emph-text>understanding neuroplasticity</span> - 
            and through that, the <span class=emph-text>growth mindset</span> - 
            is how much more confident and capable you can <span class=emph-text>immediately start becoming.</span>
            Learned skills, not innate talent.
            You understand: <span class=emph-text>you can be more</span>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the old <span class=emph-text>fixed mindset</span> of how 'smart' or 'talented' a person is, 
            challenge feels like an <span class=emph-text>upper limit</span>. 
            It's the end of your learning - 
            it's too much, I'm not smart enough to get this, it's not for me.
            But <span class=emph-text>neuroplasticity proves the opposite</span> - 
            challenge is <span class=emph-text>the start</span> of your learning. 
            Challenge is where learning happens!
            'Failure' is information-gathering, adversity is experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class=emph-text>Go forth, embrace challenge.</span> You will not immediately succeed.
            You will struggle. You will fail.
            You will stall the engine, you will veer the steering,
            you will forget to check your mirrors,
            you will scrape the curb with your tires,
            you will park crookedly in parallel spaces.
            <span class=emph-text>And you will learn to drive.</span>
          </p>

          <h3>Further reading</h3>

          <p>
            There are a few books in particular that have been helpful to my personal journey and understanding myself.
            In particular, I want to mention <span class=emph-text><em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</em>, by Mark Manson.</span>
            That title sounds very dramatic and eye-catching, and the author's writing style is similarly emotive and expressive,
            which makes for an engaging read.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mark Manson's book isn't about neuroplasticity particularly,
            but he does land on a few crux elements of self: that challenge, struggle and pain are inevitable.
            That we must choose what is worth struggling for;
            that we need to become comfortable with this struggle in order to grow;
            that in making our struggle self-defining, and avoiding it - we only stifle ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>It's not a book about learning not to give a fuck <span class="emph-text">at all</span>.
            It's about learning how to determine <span class=emph-text>what is worth</span> giving a fuck about,
            and accepting the challenges that those values come with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you value learning? New skills, effective communication, self-reflection?
            Learning is hard. Learning is struggle. Accept that struggle, <span class=emph-text>and learn</span>.
          </p>
            <span class="captx">
              <p>__________</p>
              <p>
                “Because when you give too many fucks — when you give a fuck about everyone and everything —
                you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times,
                that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be.
                <em>This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive.</em>
                You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal.
                You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster,
                running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere.”
              </p>
              <p class="emph-text">Mark Manson, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</em></p>
              <p>__________</p>
              <p>
                “At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail,
                where we instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we’re already good at.
                This confines us and stifles us. 
                We can be truly successful only at something we’re willing to fail at. 
                If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed.”
              </p>

          <h3>In my personal journey</h3>

            <p>
              I've actually been thinking along this way, in my own halting degrees, for a few years.
              It has been a big part of my personal growth, especially in how I conduct myself emotional and practically.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent a long time 'accepting' that I was inherently a failure;
              since all the things I was producing weren't enough, that I wasn't enough.
              Well, a few years ago I woke up to that not having to be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a long hard journey.
              Some ruts are worn deep.
              The carriage wheels slip into them easily.
              It takes a lot of effort and some time to wrest the carriage out again. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I did also look up some guides and information on neuroplasticity in those with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular ADHD.
              My forebrain started developing later (it was noticeable by the time I was three), it developed slower.
              I'm old enough now that it isn't developing <span class=emph-text>fundamentally</span> at all, anymore.
              But it is <span class=emph-text>still making new connections</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My brain lagged behind in processing emotion and communication autonomously,
              so I learned to socialise deliberately, and I've been learning to process emotion deliberately, too.
              It's the slower path, but it is getting me where I need to go.
