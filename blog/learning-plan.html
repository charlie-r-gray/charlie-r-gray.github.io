            <h1>A learning plan</h1>
            <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Looking to the future</h3>
            <p>
                I know better than to try and predict the future at this point! But I'm generally adaptable (with notice, at least), and a fast learner. 
                Driven by a desire to know many things, often for the sake of knowing them - I'd be capable of doing almost anything, 
                so long as the work was varied enough and I was always encouraged to be doing <span class="emph-text">more</span>. 
                Coding is incredibly broad, and yet, even deeper still. There is no point in code where you can lean back and say, '<span class="emph-text">okay, I'm done. Now what?</span>' 
            </p>

            <h3>Strengths and weaknesses in learning</h3>
            <p>
                I went into this a bit on my identities page, but in short: I have two modes. I either work incredibly hard to the point that my well-being suffers, 
                or I struggle to work at all to the point that my work suffers. And, fun fact: the reason for the unsustainable first thing, is to make up for the inevitable second thing.
            </p>
            <p> 
                It's a vicious cycle, as each mode inspires and creates the other. 
                I have to work twice as hard so that I can get half as far, and yet, anything less than success or meeting set expectations must be laziness.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not because I think that's the ideal, though. 
                It's that I've not really experienced an environment where needing your own time was just... okay. Work is always first. It was my duty, as a good obedient child, 
                to sacrifice myself this way. All the other stuff like reading and toys and playing outside? They're for after everything else was done, and so if those things weren't done, you weren't allowed to relax; 
                relaxing when you had work to do was punishable.
            </p>
            <p>
                To need anything else was to be self-centred, to express pain was to demand attention (and was also punishable): "Stop throwing a pity party." 
                "'Poor me, poor me'." "I'll give you something to cry about." My well-being is irrelevant; my output is all that matters.
            <p>
                I'm not in that environment anymore, but unfortunately, like most of our childhoods, I took it with me. 
                To this day, I can't really 'relax' while I have work. I always feel guilty. Which means my motivation for doing work often isn't even the work itself - 
                it's to get my brain off my back so I can play a game or watch a TV show without feeling like an irredeemable, lazy, selfish, disgusting, useless $%^&bird about it.
            </p>
            <p>So yeah, the quality of my work - and more importantly, my health - suffers. It's... not ideal. I've known that logically for a long, long time. 
                Knowing that emotionally is taking me much, much longer.</p>
            

            <h3>Developing core skills with EDA</h3>    
            <p>
                Hahaha if you could help me unpack and fix all the $%^& I just dumped up in the section above you, that'd be aces!
            </p>
            <p>
                Ahh, but really: there isn't a lot you can do in that respect. The pain I have now is the pain my emotional scars create for myself. Scars can fade, but they don't heal. 
                And there certainly isn't much one can do to absolve me of my internal monologue. (And really, who has that kind of time, anyway?)
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm so much better now, mostly. It's just when I'm very stressed that I tend to fall into the old behaviours. I'm cruel to myself, my self-talk becomes bitter and hateful, 
                nothing can satisfy me. I'll struggle to speak as I become dysfluent and stammer, or even become straight-up mute. 
            </p>
            <p>
                ...you know, it just now strikes that, in light of my last two sections, one of my motivations for even joining EDA may not be healthy, either. 
                I said that my goal was to prove myself - but I'll never feel satisfied that I've proven anything. To see how strong I've become - 
                but I'll never feel anything other than weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've talked before - to my partner, mostly - that what I really needed was a 'win'. 
                That my life consisted of failure upon failure, and that I needed a 'win' so I could have one thing I could look at, 
                and feel satisfied. That my life and self-esteem would finally be fixed, if I just WON!
            </p>
            <p>
                But... that might not be possible for me (yet?). Because the truth is that I do have wins, or at least, what should be considered wins. A lot of them! 
                And yet, I always have some reason why they don't 'count': because they don't fit the narrow definition of what I thought a 'win' should be. 
                Or that I should have done more, that it could have been better, 
                'if only I wasn't', etc. Even the things I create: people tell me they love them, but I only ever think 'that's because they can't draw so they don't realise 
                how $%^& it actually is'. Seriously, even my own self-portrait on this page - that thumb, ugh.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can really tell that I wrote this page late at night while tired and depleted, huh? All the nice Positive Vibes! fluff is gone and I'm laying my bones bare.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure the core skills of EDA will still teach me something. Perhaps something I'd never really considered or tried.
            </p>

            <h3>Managing my workload</h3>
            <p>Jeez, you scared me. Don't talk to me about workload, I'm nervous enough as it is! Okay...</p>

            <h4>Time management and schedule</h4>
            <p>
                I have a hard time scheduling myself. Mostly because I'm time-blind, so I can't ever meet the time constraints evenly 
                (I estimate how long something should take and add 50%, and that's usually more correct), and then I feel like a failure 
                for not meeting the time constraints, and rather than beat myself up for being so terrible at time-keeping, I should just accept that 
                stuff takes the times that it takes. My brain will take any excuse I can give it to feel guilty and worthless. Measuring how guilty I should feel with a clock is a risky play.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to set a (loose, forgiving, kind) schedule of <span class=emph-text>9am-12am, 2pm-5pm, 7pm-10pm</span>. Three blocks of three hours each, with two hours breaks. 
                I've made a note that I can take breaks during (if needed - though I don't assume they'd be restful), 
                but they be a max of 30min and that I have to work for at least 15min between them. I have a visual timer that can help me with the 30/15min part.
            </p>
            <h4>Working constructively and productively with others at EDA</h4>
            <p>
                Not quite sure what this question is asking? But I take my responsibilities to other people very seriously. 
                I'm certainly capable of working alongside other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do note though that my auditory-processing (hearing) is impaired; if I'm deeply focused on something, you'll need to actually get my attention before you talk to me. 
                It's not that I don't care, it's that by the time I realised you were speaking, I missed the first half. Also, if I ask you to repeat yourself, it is far more helpful to 
                speak <span class=emph-text>more clearly</span> (e-nun-ci-ate) rather than necessarily louder, but you may still need to be louder than background noise.
            </p>
            <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
            <p>
                I have a few things I do to reduce stress, both preventative and responsive (in no particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li>noise machines</li>
                    <li>music</li>
                    <li>touching soft things</li>
                    <li>take a nap</li>
                    <li>eat a treat</li>
                    <li>meditation exercises</li>
                    <li>mindfulness exercises</li>
                    <li><s>self-abuse</s> self-talk</li>
                    <li>being outside (Green Time)</li>
                </ul>
                If that really isn't enough, I'll probably have to admit that I need some leniency and talk to somebody about it.
            </p>
            <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
            <p>
                Help like... emotionally? For burnout? Or for being stuck?
            </p>
            <p>
                My problems are, first and foremost, mine. They are mine to solve, and it is my responsibility to do what I can by myself, first. 
                Asking for help anytime I got stuck or frustrated would never see either of us do anything else. Everybody else has their own work to do, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I would like to think that if I reached the point that what I was trying for myself wasn't working, 
                that I would be able to admit that I wasn't up to it and I needed support; rather than silently letting things crumble around me. 
                I've already lost enough because I was too ashamed of emotional needs to admit that I needed help - but now I'm more ashamed that I failed because I didn't ask. 
                I don't want to fall into that trap again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll admit that asking for help for emotional needs (burnout, stress, etc) is still much harder for me than asking for help for practical ones ('how do I?'). 
                The latter is a reasonable logistical problem that anybody learning has, and can't ever be shameful. 
                But the former is a reflection of my ability and worth. It makes me feel weak and pitiable. And I do still feel ashamed for needing that.
            </p>
            <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
            <p>
                Not sure. I don't know what I can expect. I think what I'd value the most is getting good, constructive feedback.
