            <h1>A learning plan</h1>
            <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Looking to the future</h3>
            <p>
                I know better than to try and predict the future at this point! But I'm generally adaptable (with notice, at least), and a fast learner. 
                Driven by a desire to know many things, often for the sake of knowing them - I'd be capable of doing almost anything, 
                so long as the work was varied enough and I was always encouraged to be doing <span class="emph-text">more</span>. 
                Coding is incredibly broad, and yet, even deeper still. There is no point in code where you can lean back and say, '<span class="emph-text">okay, I'm done. Now what?</span>' 
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Strengths and weaknesses in learning</h3>
            <p>
                I went into this a bit on my identities page, but in short: <span class="emph-text">I have two modes</span>. I either work incredibly hard to the point that my well-being suffers, 
                or I struggle to work at all to the point that my work suffers. And, <span class="emph-text">fun fact</span>: 
                the reason for the <span class="emph-text">unsustainable</span> first thing, is to make up for the <span class="emph-text">inevitable</span> second thing.
            </p>
            <p> 
                It's a <span class="emph-text">vicious cycle</span>, as each mode inspires and creates the other. 
                I have to work twice as hard so that I can get half as far, and yet, a constant '<span class="emph-text">failure to meet up to my potential</span>': 
                including what I set for myself. 
                For years I was convinced I was incapable of succeeding; 
                that since I was always insufficient, the effort wasn't worth it. 
                (In psychology, this is called '<span class="emph-text">learned helplessness</span>'.)
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not because I think that's the ideal, though. In fact, I'm here because I've learned otherwise. 
                It's that for a long, long time, I'd not experienced an environment where looking after yourself first was just... okay. 
                Both home life and school life always put responsibilities before relaxation, no matter your condition. 
                Relaxation was a <span class="emph-text">luxury</span>, not a mental nor emotional need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though my environment has improved, our childhood lessons are hard to unlearn.  
                To this day, I can't really 'relax' with work to do. <span class="emph-text">I just feel guilty</span>. 
                I may exhaust myself trying to get work done, just so I can play a game or watch a TV show without feeling like a $%^&y person.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad that our world is <span class="emph-text">waking up</span> to how <span class="emph-text">harmful</span> that attitude really is. 
                Emotional needs a finally being recognised as just that: <span class="emph-text">needs</span>. 
                People are pushing for better work-life balance, that mental health is as valid of needing sick days as physical health is.
            </p>
            <p>
                EDA is my first experience with an education institution that really observes and cares about the mental wellness of its faculty and students, 
                and particularly: considers that <span class="emph-text">wellness to be more important</span> than their output.
            </p>

                <hr>
            <h3>Developing core skills with EDA</h3>    
            <p>
                At this point, <span class="emph-text">my enemy is myself</span>. I know much of what a healthy person should look like; 
                I just <span class="emph-text">struggle to grow</span> into it. 
                My greatest struggle now is from emotional scars. Scars can fade, but they don't heal. 
                And there certainly isn't much one can do to absolve me of my internal monologue. 
            </p>
            <p>
                ...you know, it <span class="emph-text">just now strikes me</span> that one of my motivations for even joining EDA <span class="emph-text">may not be healthy</span>, either. 
                I said that my goal was to <span class="emph-text">prove myself</span> - but I'll never feel satisfied that I've proven anything. 
                To see <span class="emph-text">how strong</span> I've become - but I'll never feel anything other than not strong enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've said before that what I <span class="emph-text">really needed</span> was a 'win': to have one thing I could look at, and <span class="emph-text">feel satisfied</span>. 
                That my life has been <span class="emph-text">nothing but failures</span>, and my self-esteem could finally be fixed, <span class="emph-text">if I just WON!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                But... <span class="emph-text">that's not right, is it?</span> Because the truth is that I <span class="emph-text">do have wins</span> (or what should be, at least). 
                <span class="emph-text">A lot of them!</span>  
                And yet, I always have some reason why they <span class="emph-text">don't 'count':</span> 
                because they don't fit the <span class="emph-text">narrow definition</span> of what I thought a 'win' should be. 
                Or that I should have done more, that it could have been better, <span class="emph-text">'if only I wasn't'</span>, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the kind words and compliments I receive can feel hollow, perfunctory, performative. 
                Because if they <span class="emph-text">actually knew me</span>, they'd know I didn't deserve praise, right? 
                They'd know that I had a <span class="emph-text">'potential'</span> that I still wasn't living up to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure the core skills of EDA <span class="emph-text">will still teach me</span> something. 
                Perhaps something I'd <span class="emph-text">never really considered</span> or tried. 
                It's one of the aspects of EDA I'm <span class="emph-text">most curious</span> about.
            </p>

                <hr>
            <h3>Managing my workload</h3>

            <h4>Time management and schedule</h4>
            <p>
                I have a hard time scheduling myself. Mostly because I'm <span class="emph-text">time-blind</span>, so I can't ever meet the time constraints evenly: 
                I estimate how long something should take, <span class="emph-text">add 50%</span>, and that's usually more correct. Then I feel like a failure 
                for <span class="emph-text">not meeting</span> the time constraints - so rather than beat myself up for being so terrible at time-keeping, 
                I should <span class="emph-text">just accept</span> that stuff takes the times that it takes. 
                It's <span class="emph-text">very easy</span> for me to feel guilty for not doing enough. Measuring <span class="emph-text">how guilty</span> I should feel with a clock, is a risky play.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to set a (loose, forgiving, kind) schedule of <span class=emph-text>[9am-12am], [2pm-5pm], [7pm-10pm]</span>. Three blocks of three hours each, with two hours breaks. 
                I've made a note that I can take breaks during (if needed - though I don't assume they'd be restful), 
                but they be a max of 30min and that I have to work for at least 15min between them. 
                I have a <span class="emph-text">visual timer</span> that can help me with the 30/15min part.
            </p>
            <h4>Working constructively and productively with others at EDA</h4>
            <p>
                Not quite sure what this question is asking? But I take my responsibilities to other people <span class="emph-text">very seriously</span>. 
                I'm certainly capable of working alongside other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do note though that my <span class="emph-text">auditory-processing (hearing) is impaired</span>; 
                if I'm deeply focused on something, you'll need to actually get my attention before you talk to me. 
                It's not that I don't care, it's that by the time I <span class="emph-text">realised</span> you were speaking, I missed the first half. 
                Also, if I ask you to repeat yourself, it is far more helpful to 
                speak <span class=emph-text>more clearly</span> (e-nun-ci-ate) rather than necessarily louder, 
                but you <span class="emph-text">may still</span> need to be louder than background noise.
            </p>
            <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
            <p>
                I have a few things I do to reduce stress, both preventative and responsive (in no particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li>noise machines</li>
                    <li>music</li>
                    <li>touching soft things</li>
                    <li>take a nap</li>
                    <li>eat a treat</li>
                    <li>meditation exercises</li>
                    <li>mindfulness exercises</li>
                    <li><s>self-abuse</s> self-talk</li>
                    <li>being outside (Green Time)</li>
                </ul>
                If that really isn't enough, I'll probably have to admit that I need some leniency and talk to somebody about it.
            </p>
            <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
            <p>
                Help like... emotionally? For burnout? Or for being stuck?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="emph-text">My problems are, first and foremost, mine.</span> They are mine to solve, and it is my responsibility to do what I can by myself, first. 
                Asking for help anytime I got stuck or frustrated would never see either of us do anything else. Everybody else has their own work to do, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I would like to think that if I reached the point that what I was trying for myself wasn't working, 
                that I would be able to admit that I wasn't up to it and I needed support; rather than silently letting things crumble around me. 
                I've already lost enough because I was too ashamed of emotional needs to admit that I needed help - but now I'm more ashamed that I failed because I didn't ask.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asking for help for emotional needs ('I'm not okay') is still much harder for me than asking for help for practical ones ('how do I?'). 
                The latter is a reasonable logistical problem that anybody learning has, and can't ever be shameful. 
                But the former is a reflection of my ability and worth. It makes me feel weak and pitiable. And I do still feel ashamed for needing that.
            </p>
            <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
            <p>
                Not sure. I don't know what I can expect. I think what I'd value the most is getting good, constructive feedback. Especially if responsive and timely.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's probably helpful for you to acknowledge the things I have learned and done well (because I'm not good at noticing that, myself), 
                but for me to believe it, it can't sound like flattery. So... tricky tightrope to walk. I don't envy you.
