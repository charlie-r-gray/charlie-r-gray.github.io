          <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
          <h2>Life is struggle</h2>


          <hr>
          <h3>Experiencing problems, personally</h3>
          <p>
            Problems are normal. Humans a problem-solving machines. We get our satisfaction from solving problems; we become depressed otherwise. May you be blessed with good problems. May your struggle earn you good things. May your pain be a worthy price for your joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're emotional beings. Our logical problems come with emotional ones. Ashamed we can't solve it, sad we might never solve it, angry that the error was 'something stupid', relief that the problem is solved, pride at our progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            My small working memory doesn't have much space to spare. It does one thing at a time, and emotion can take up a lot of space. Every logical problem comes with an emotional problem, too. Logical problems become incredibly difficult to solve when you're experiencing emotional problems, and if you can only hold one problem at a time, emotional problems have to be solved first.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I have a problem, I have two options: I postpone it, and I return to it exactly the same as when I left. Or I push through, by frustration and determination and discipline and pain. I solve my problems by confronting them. By eking out any measure of progress that I can claim as victory. There is no 'leaving and coming back to it' - when your memory holds one object at a time, a problem either consumes you, or it doesn't exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solving problems logically when you have no emotional problems feels easy. There are many tools to use and most of them work. But when your bandwidth is taken up by being frustrated, solving logical problems can feel straight up impossible. And that's true of anyone! My circumstances are more unusual in that I don't have much bandwidth to start with, but emotional management is a big part of a success in solving logical problems!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why 'help' is inevitably the best problem-solving I have. Solving the emotional problems myself is also very effective, but takes so much more time, because it has to be the only thing I'm doing. When I am consumed, my only resolution is progress, even the illusion of it. Even anticipating help will allow me to relax: my emotional problems take less bandwidth, and I finally have enough bandwidth to solve the logical problem myself. (It's bitterly poetic.) If the help arrives and doesn't try to solve my problem, but 'lead me' to solving it, that also doesn't help me. I can't comprehend this right now. I don't have enough space left. I don't need someone to tell me where to look. I need to free up some bandwidth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog didn't exist for a while. Then it did again, and even though a week had passed, it was exactly as painful. All the emotion can rolling back - the frustration with the instructions, the self-blame for my literal interpretation, the self-abuse for how useless I was being... so I went to the dog park for a couple hours (attend yourself), talked the emotions out (rubber ducky), considered what that meant for me (reflection), set myself a new target to what a 'good enough' blog page was (reduce)... and came back to write it again. Because like I've said in the EQ blog - humans are emotion. It's not that I couldn't solve the logical problem; it's that as an emotional being, my emotional problem - my well-being - was more important, and I wasn't make it enough of a priority.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here I am again. Third time's the charm.

          <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            There are many ways one can solve problems, and each is especially good at compensating for a certain bias, meeting an unseen need, or augmenting our own ability.
          </p>

          <h4>Take a Break - attend yourself.</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most effective, and simplest, problem-solving methods. For most people, this is an opportunity to relax, to avoid the fretful overthinking, to make the problem a background run-time and perhaps solve it intuitively just on accident while you're otherwise doing something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have a shower. Have a nap. Take a walk. Admire the garden. Let possibilities sink, drift, emerge, and crest the many waves of absent thought - eventually one may knock your boat, one that works.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows you to solve your problems more intuitively, to sift through the knowledge you have in a more relaxed way. You're not pressuring yourself to return immediate results, you're not triggering stress and burrowing through the code like a feral animal. You attend to your emotional needs - stress, fear, frustration. And then, in an environment absent of those things, you can solve your logical problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            This doesn't work for me personally in the same way - I'm very 'out of sight, out of mind'. I don't generally solve logical problems while out for a walk. But taking a break from logical problems does offer me the environment to focus on and resolve emotional problems, which frees bandwidth.
          </p>

          <h4>Pseudocode - simplify.</h4>
          <p>
            Pseudo is writing out what you want to do in plain language, rather than creating something functional from the get-go. It's great if you already have an idea of what you'd like to do, and you just need to get it down so you can remember and refer to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pseudo works because it simplifies your problem. You don't have to build the whole body at once - just a simple skeleton. Then you can focus on each individual bone one at a time. In a learning environment, you also show you understand the logic of what you're doing, and syntax is where you're sticking. Be aware that pseudo is most effective when you are aware of what your problem is, though. If you don't know where to start on a problem, it's hard to write a possible solution in plain language.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works on emotion, too - you don't need to send that long ranting text message, or that angry email. But you can 'pseudo' your emotion in a txt file. Write out what you really feel, organically, in real time. When you engage with emotion this way, you'll find your writing rapidly converges on the core source of your distress, and not necessarily the initial reason you started typing - a fear that you won't be good enough, an anger that somebody else let you down, whatever. After that, you have a great tool for understanding your emotional state externally, in plain language. Something to reflect on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I personally find pseudo useful both technically (getting my ideas out while I can remember them), and emotionally (understanding emotional distress externally where they can be mindfully observed). After a long emotion-pseudo, it's fascinating to reread once all the emotion is poured into the vessel. The version of me at the end of the txt file is so different from the one at the beginning. Truly, expressing emotion (safely) is a much better management tool than suppression. Then I exit without saving!
          </p>

          <h4>Rubber Ducky - externalise.</h4>
          <p>
            Explain your problem. This is what you want to do. This is how you're trying to do it. This is each step you're doing about it, and why that worksâ€” ooh I forgot a bracket, lmaooo
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rubber Ducky is yet another method of reduction, one that compensates for the brain's 'symbol' bias. See, your brain takes in a lot of information. More than it can feasibly process in detail. So... it doesn't. It converts them to 'symbols'.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I tell you to picture a tree in your mind's eye... you see a tree. But if I ask you to draw it, how crooked it is, how low its branches are, the shape of its leaves, what type of fruit or flower blooms in it, you don't immediately know. Because you didn't picture a literal tree, like a photograph. You picture a symbol of tree - a cloud on a stalk, a mass of green on a spiderweb of brown, or perhaps a silhouette.
          </p>
          <p>
            This reduction of information to symbols is why 'cars come out of nowhere' on familiar routes - our brains replace visual information with memories of all the other times we've driven on that road. And it's why we need proof-readers - we see what we remember writing, not what's in front of us. It's why artists flip their canvas - to see what they drew, and not what they remember drawing.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it's why you rubber duck - to explain what your code is, and not what you remember writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works for emotional problems, too. A lot of the time, that's what a therapist or a counsellor is actually doing. Their job isn't to tell you what to do (as part of their profession, they actually can't tell you how to solve your problems). They may point out harmful thoughts, or loop back statements or consciously highlight your subconscious body language. But mostly, their job is to listen - they are a space for you to rubber duck your emotional state, to explain what you're feeling and why, to help you figure out where it comes from and what you might do about it by explaining your emotions in an external space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, the rubber duck doesn't help with logical problems while dealing with emotional problems. But if I can make the time for it, I can certainly use it for emotional problems. It's very helpful to explain why I'm upset with somebody to a wall or a plush toy. It doesn't have to talk back for me to better understand my problem.
          </p>

          <h4>Error messages - understand your problem.</h4>
          <p>
            Our first method contained to computer logic! When our code fails to compile or load properly, and error message isn't just a warning that it didn't work. It will tell you why it didn't work, too - and that's key.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might say something like 'tried to declare "name", but it is already declared. Okay, so you know you reused a variable name. Or it might say "can't call getName(), it isn't a function". Okay, so your formatting on that is wrong - probably a missed brace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and it gets better - errors will also tell you where the error ocurred. It will tell you what file caused it, and what line. You can go straight there. It will even tell you the 'column' - how deep in a long line should you look?
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't love errors, but I do love error logging. To solve a problem, we need to know what our problem is. Then we can become to solve why the problem exists. Understanding why something doesn't work is the hard part. Getting it to work is just a matter of time!
          </p>

          <h4>Console logging - find your problem.</h4>
          <p>
            Information is your friend! You can use the console to tell you anything you need to know. Put a console.log(`It works!`) in your function to make sure it is being called correctly. Use console.log(`I've looped ${i} times`) to find out the point at which your loop is failing. Log each variable after you declare it, each step of your code. You can even log what you've been handed with console.log(typeof variableName) and check what you're actually holding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Console logging supplements your error codes - when your code compiles fine, but still doesn't do what you tell it to do, using console.log on each step tells you where it goes wrong. Does one suddenly return undefined? Is the count wrong? Is the image src you're fetching already resolved?
          </p>
          <p>
            Log, log, log!
          </p>

          <h4>Google it - fill your knowledge gaps.</h4>
          <p>
            Nobody remembers everything. Even your doctor googles your symptoms - the difference is that they know enough to search for real terms, that they recognise the appropriate medical repositories, that they can understand what they're reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, coders don't remember everything, either. They don't even write everything. A lot of coding is asking Google your problem, finding code somebody else wrote before you, and changing it to your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're not expected to remember everything; that's impossible. When we can't solve a problem, or even pseudo it, because we don't know how - Google, MDN Docs, W3Schools, StackOverflow etc are all repositories that can answer our questions. We have an absence of knowledge, like anybody. The information is out there. Ask Google your question; somebody else has probably asked it.
          </p>

          <h4>Asking for help - all of the above.</h4>
          <p>
            Maybe your problem is too specific for Google. Maybe you don't know what your problem is. Maybe you've tried all the other methods and still don't know what you're doing. That's where help comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember - your brain remembers everything as simplified symbols. Your help has no such bias. They see what you have actually written. They have knowledge you don't, their mind makes intuitive connections yours doesn't. Coding problems can be solved in any number of ways - maybe theirs works better for what you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            During foundations, I haven't been that good at asking for help. I was constantly struggling, 'falling behind', getting frustrated, all of it. But I wouldn't put the problem down. I couldn't relax, I couldn't go for a walk, it was just looping in my head. If I asked for help, and it didn't come immediately, I still hammered away at it, because I had no other choice. So I'd eventually solve it without them - which just meant the next time I was struggling, I waited even longer to ask. I didn't want to 'bother' people asking for help if I was going to solve it before they arrived, anyway. I didn't want to look foolish asking for support with issues nobody else seemed to be having.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time I would ask for help, I'd given up. I used to ask for help once I was consumed, a feral animal. It was shameful, admitting I wasn't capable of doing it myself - maybe ever, I would fear. Now I ask earlier, when I can feel the animal scratching at the walls. It's emotional management - I can see I'm getting frustrated. Resolving frustration adequately takes more time than waiting for help does. Asking for help is worth it.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Improvise! - try something.</h4>
          <p>
            Just make a guess and attempt something. Let your intuitive knowledge guide you, where your deliberate knowledge has failed you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it the braces? Did you miss a colon, a comma? Did you forget quotes around a string? What if you swap dot notation for bracket?
          </p>
          <p>
            Do something. Try something. Try anything. Console, google, breaks. Let the version of you that excels at ideas - your subconscious state - solve the problem for you.
          </p>

          <h4>Reflection - understand yourself.</h4>
          <p>
            A more abstract, cerebral method. This isn't just about solving your current problem, it's preparing yourself to solve future problems. It's looking at what you've just done, and thinking... what could have been different?
          </p>
          <p>
            When I refused to ask for help to 'avoid bothering people', 'that'll take too long', or because 'I know I can do this eventually', I become solely responsible for my own frustration. Sometimes that worked. Sometimes it didn't, and I'd ask for help anyway. But I still had to deal with that frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflection is my looking back, and thinking, 'this wasn't worth it'. How much time did I save, not waiting for help? Was it anything? Because when trying to solve things by myself made me feel tired, depleted, angry... my time went into that, instead. My work took so much longer. My health suffered, and with it, my time management.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's why I don't spend as much time abusing myself for not getting coursework done. Scheduling nine hours of work, and just sitting in my chair staring at the screen. Pushing myself against the clock, 'it's not enough! Not enough!' Coursework is work, but it isn't the only work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflection is sitting in the dog park, spending time talking to myself about my own emotion. It's recognising that my emotional work IS WORK, that it can make me tired, that it isn't a real 'break', that it isn't fair to myself to go back to logical problems immediately just because my emotional ones are 'solved'.
