          <h2>Life is struggle</h2>

          <h3>Experiencing problems</h3>
          <p>
            Problems are... sticky. They're normal - both logical and emotional. Humans a problem-solving machines. We get our satisfaction from solving problems; we become depressed otherwise. May you be blessed with good problems. May your struggle earn you good things. May your pain be a worthy price for your joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're emotional beings. Our logical problems come with emotional ones. Ashamed we can't solve it, sad we might never solve it, angry that the error was 'something stupid', relief that the problem is solved, pride at what we have done.
          </p>
          <p>
            My relationship with problems is still fraught. Specifically, emotional problems - everything we do and experience comes with emotion. How we feel about problems undeniably affects our ability to solve them. That emotion is what makes some of the methods I'm about to cover work. Add in neurological disorders that impair emotional comprehension and regulation, and a generous scoop of emotional abuse to damage your relationship with emotions themselves... and you've got a nasty cocktail that does nothing but stand in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a personal standpoint, my ability resolve emotional problems is still being developed. I have my own hard history, I have my own bad lessons to unlearn. Nobody is still telling me the cruel things I still habitually tell myself. I tried to write this blog in great distress, postponed it a week, and felt on top of the world. I opened up the page to keep writing it, and came back to the same distress.
          </p>
          <p>
            See, the thing about having a small working memory: it doesn't have much space to spare. It does one thing at a time. And emotion can take up a lot of space. And every logical problem comes with an emotional problem, too. Logical problems become incredibly difficult to solve when you're experiencing emotional problems, and you can only hold one problem at a time, so emotional problems have to be solved first.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I have a problem, I have two options: I postpone it, and I return to it exactly the same as when I left. Or I push through, by frustration and determination and discipline and pain. I solve my problems by confronting them. By eking out any measure of progress that I can claim as victory. There is no 'leaving and coming back to it' - when your memory holds one object at a time, a problem either consumes you, or it doesn't exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why 'help' is easily the best problem-solving I have. Solving the emotional problems is also very effective, but takes so much more time. When I am consumed, my only resolution is progress, even the illusion of it. Even anticipating help will allow me to relax: my emotional problems take less bandwidth, and I finally have enough bandwidth to solve the logical problem myself. (It's bitterly poetic.) If the help arrives and doesn't try to solve my problem, but 'lead me' to solving it, that also doesn't help me. I can't comprehend this right now. I don't have enough space left. I don't need you to tell me where to look. I need you to free up some bandwidth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog didn't exist for a while. Then it did again, and even though a week had passed, it was exactly as painful. So I went to the dog park for a couple hours (take a break), talked it out (rubber ducky), did some reflection (reflection), set myself a new target to what a 'good enough' blog page was (reduce), and came back to write it again. Because like I've said in the EQ blog - humans are emotion. It's not that I couldn't solve the logical problem; it's that my emotional problem was more important, and I wasn't make it enough of a priority.
          </p>

            Third time's the charm.
