            <h1>A Learning Plan II</h1>
            <h2>Electric Boogaloo</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Looking to the future</h3>
            <p>
              I don't have any specific long-term goals for what to do with the skills I'm developing; I'm still enjoying the theory. I expect that Bootcamp is going to introduce some new ideas on it's own, and then the careers week will help give me a better idea of what options are out there.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ask a kid what they want to be when they grow up, almost none of them will say 'refrigerator repair' or 'I want to make the transistors that go into a Smart TV', even if they end up genuinely enjoying that work. There's just so much out there that I don't know about yet. Some of them may suit me very well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that working with people is one of my strengths, so I could imagine being in a supervisory or leadership role one day. Sure I'm strange, but I'm personable and love learning about people. I like the idea of having a role at EDA once I've have the opportunity to skill up a bit more!
            </p>

            <h3>Strengths and weaknesses in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              I still struggle with managing my time and emotional workload. I'm getting better, but it takes time. So I'm still going to have to spend hours at a time looking after my well-being. Then I'm still going to end up sacrificing my well-being working so hard to make up for all the time spent doing that.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Moving into Bootcamp</h3>
            <h4>Non-technical challenges</h3>
            <p>
              Managing stress, managing time, managing focus.
            </p>
            <h4>Improving human skills</h3>
            <p>
              Learning to better manage the above. Especially stress.
            </p>
            <h4>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
            <p>
              Same stuff I've already been getting: compassion, understanding, support.
            </p>
            <h4>Expectations from myself</h3>
            <p>
              I have great potential as a coder. I'm less sure of my capability as a person in general. Whatever happens, I'll still want to keep learning. I'm already getting better at asking for help sooner (even if I'm still often solving it myself minutes later).
