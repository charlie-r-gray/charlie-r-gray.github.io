            <h3>Looking to the future</h3>
            <p>
              I don't have any specific long-term goals for what to do with the skills I'm developing; I'm still enjoying the theory. I expect that Bootcamp is going to introduce some new ideas on it's own, and then the careers week will help give me a better idea of what options are out there.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ask a kid what they want to be when they grow up, almost none of them will say 'refrigerator repair' or 'I want to make the transistors that go into a Smart TV', even if they end up genuinely enjoying that work. There's just so much out there that I don't know about yet. Some of them may suit me very well.
            </p>

            <h3>Strengths and weaknesses in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              My strengths and limitations still feel exactly the same. Foundations didn't make trauma go away, Foundations didn't make my working memory bigger. I didn't sit in Sprint 2 evaluating my worth as a person; I was acknowledging personal limitations, and the detours I had learned to take to circumvent them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm still going to have to spend hours at a time looking after my well-being. Then I'm still going to end up sacrificing my well-being working so hard to make up for all the time spent doing that.
            </p>

            <h3>Non-technical challenges in Bootcamp</h3>
            <h4>Emotional Management</h4>
            <p>
              I have confidence in my ability to understand the material and it's logic, even if I don't retain the information in my head very well. I can understand what I'm doing to the information, even if I don't remember what the information is. So my biggest challenge won't be technical; it will be personal. It will be the inevitable need for emotional work, taking time to look after myself - and the struggle to fit that in while working for 60+ hours a week.
            </p>
            <h4>Time Management</h4>
            <p>
              Waking up at 6:30 so I'm at the office in time at 8:45 is a big one; the time it takes for me to get up and bike here is huge (but still generally worth it since the rate at which I work is so much better here). Making sure I have the time for well-being. I know I'm going to need sleep but I don't know where I'm going to put WORK if I just always need to do more work, because I'm already barely doing anything else. So odds are good I'll accidentally sacrifice sleep.
            </p>
            <h4>Attention Span</h4>
            <p>
              I work really hard for short bursts, and then I'm tired and need a break. I'm really going to struggle sitting in a lecture for an hour, let alone an hour-half. That's a lot of time doing one. Single. Thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              No short walks outside. No leaving to make a cup of tea and come back. No sitting outside on the front step in the sun. I have fidget toys, but if the information isn't even that dense (a lot of waffling, repetition, waiting for things to load...) it's going to be water torture. Not quite enough to prevent autonomously disconnecting. I'll suddenly realise, over and over, that I don't know what's just happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or I'll need to experiment to understand - let me play with a sample so I can change it and twist it and pull it apart - they'll keep pushing more stuff in and I won't UNDERSTAND it because I didn't have enough time to understand what it was built upon and so all the information that comes after doesn't MEAN ANYTHING and so I'm worried I'll spend hours sitting in a lecture I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF LISTEN TO and then I have to do EVEN MORE HOURS rewatching it again at my OWN PACE except I won't even be able to do THAT because we'll move to PEER work and by then I'll need to understand some of what is happening and I WON'T YET AAAAHHHHH
            </p>
            <p>
              I honestly didn't feel that anxious about such this morning. But I had the Zoom meeting for Human Skills, and I tried, I really tried, I pulled out four different tools and I stretched my arms and cricked my neck and tapped my feet and TRIED. But after a half-hour I was feeling mad. I had all this pent-up energy that wasn't going anywhere. I have no idea what happened in the last half-hour of it because eventually after realising I was still zoning out and just staring at my own webcam, I started doing formatting for this page. I couldn't MAKE myself LISTEN. I couldn't MAKE myself. It wasn't WORKING. So at the very least, I'D work.

            <h3>Improving human skills in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              I don't know. Fucking cure my brain, maybe. I've learned a lot of theory for talking to people, but the biggest limitations in working WITH people are brain things. It's stuff like not contributing (because I forget), interrupting (or I'll forget), not noticing something you did/said (because I'm concentrating on not forgetting), not making eye contact with you (because I'm writing stuff down so I won't forget), not understanding what you said (because you took so long to say it that I forgot how it started).
            </p>
            <p>
              Do I KNOW people want me to contribute? Do I KNOW they don't want me to interrupt? Do I KNOW they want to feel heard? Sure. But pick which one of those actually matters most to you, because I'm not able to do all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't know why writing this blog is making me feel so awful. Maybe because it's asking me to look at all the things I'm bad at, and they're all things I ALREADY KNOW I'm bad at, and they're all things I hurt myself for years trying to pretend I WASN'T bad at, because everybody made it clear that being bad at them made me a shitty person... before I finally realised it was never about personality. I entered a bike race with a bike that had flat tires. I'm exhausting myself peddling hard to get up those hills, and everybody is still annoyed that I've falling behind. I'm working twice as hard to get half as far, and I'm FUCKING TIRED of people asking me to explain why I got half as far as they did. FUCK YOU. I'M NOT YOU. Don't you DARE fucking imply that I don't know what I'm doing because I'm not doing it the way YOU do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing reflections on myself like this always makes me feel tired and angry, because they always ask me 'where do you struggle' (oh my brain is broken) 'and how will you fix it' (oh kill myself I guess)
