          <h1>Study of Self</h1>
          <h2>Identity, and Values</h2>
          <hr>
        <h3>Self-critical, literal, hard-working, absurd...</h3>

          <h4>The core of my values:</h4>

            <p>My core personal values will probably sound much the same as anybody else's: <span class=emph-text>kindness, openness, communication, compassion</span>. 
                Our world is full of such a huge range of people with diverse experiences, that leads each of them to unique conclusions. 
                Even if I don't agree with a given person's final conclusion, I can understand how a reasonable person can reach it in their circumstances. 
                <span class=emph-text>Nobody exists in a vacuum</span>, all of us embody the consequences of our own circumstances and histories.</p>

            <h4>How are these values demonstrated?</h4>
 
            <p>Most of the 'ethical decisions' I get involved in are mediating interpersonal conflicts.</p>
            
            <p>Usually, nobody has really done anything 'wrong'; 
                it is simple two parties with <span class=emph-text>differing communication, misunderstanding</span> each other. Can one always know the difference 
                between a person who is 'being rude and disrespectful to you', vs merely tired and brusque? Or perhaps two parties with unmet needs, who don't know 
                how to communicate those needs to each other.</p>
            <p> Both can feel like the victim, entitled to retaliate - and they are, in that they both have <span class=emph-text>real hurts and real needs</span> - 
                but once a conversation becomes adversarial, it's much harder to resolve kindly.</p>
            <p>We grow up on fairy-tales, on heroes and villains. And it is natural for our brains to think that way, when we are slighted. 
                But <span class=emph-text>the world is much more nuanced that that</span>. Most abusers were first abused. Most misbehaviour starts at home. 
                The most dangerous people are the most desperate.
            </p>

            <h4>Why am I the way that I am?</h4>
    
            <p>I do believe that both my <span class=emph-text>ASD</span> and <span class=emph-text>ADHD</span>, and the resulting childhood (not great. 
                <span class=emph-text>F--</span>, would not buy again), are the largest factors into my playing this mediation role, for two reasons.</p>
                
            <p>Firstly: <span class=emph-text>socialisation</span> was a vital skill I learned deliberately: <span class=emph-text>patience, 
                projection, perception, empathy</span>. As a result, I have always been 
                learning those skills. Whereas most autonomous learners <span class=emph-text>tend to slow</span> once they've enough to satisfy their in-group, 
                I have always sought to continue expanding it.</p>
                
                <p class=captx>Though, it's still a skill that's most practiced when in <span class=emph-text>considered reflection</span>, rather than 'in the field'.</p>

            <p>And the more you know people, how they think and feel, what hurts them and what fulfils them... how can you not love them? Our world is so varied and 
                wonderful and beautiful and painful and <span class=emph-text>real</span>. Everybody has stories. Everybody's life is <span class=emph-text>infinitely 
                complex and grand in scope</span>, and there will never be another person like you again. <span class=emph-text>Ever</span>.</p>

    
            <p>Secondly: my own self-worth was severely damaged even in youth, and gaining self-respect back has been a struggle. As a result, I frequently strive to prove myself - 
                that I'm useful, that I'm capable, that I'm <span class=emph-text>here, when you need me</span>. I would martyr myself, ashamed to admit that I need help 
                and 'bother' people by asking for it. (I'm getting much better at it, though!)
    
            <p>As a result, I frequently would end up being invited to mediate or explain social conflicts to people, including other less-experienced ASD/ADHD people, when I was 
                <span class=emph-text>already depleted</span>. A healthy person should recognise their needs and respectfully request time to recuperate, but I can exhaust myself 
                putting out fires I didn't start.</p>

        <h3>Strengths and weaknesses, in learning</h3>

                <p>My strengths and weaknesses are both numerous. While some are personal; many are medical, and many more are learned in childhood. 
                    How could I begin to separate them? Which ones can I change?
                </p>
                <p>I am a <span class=emph-text>quick learner</span>, I make great <span class=emph-text>intuitive leaps</span>, 
                    I'm good at <span class=emph-text>pattern recognition</span>. I enjoy deep, intellectual discussion. 
                    I care about the well-being of the people around me.
                </p>
                <p>But... I also get <span class=emph-text>easily distracted</span>. I have a hard time starting tasks that don't interest me; I have a hard time stopping tasks that do. 
                    My <span class=emph-text>excitement and curiosity</span> is the main source of motivation. I'm so excited to solve problems that 
                    I don't give enough space for others to contribute. <span class=emph-text>I struggle to pace myself.</span> 
                    I'm like a labrador; alternating between napping on the couch, and pulling at the leash.
                </p>

                <h4>In group work:</h4>

                <p>My struggles working with other people mostly related to my <span class=emph-text>irregular pacing</span>. 
                    I have yet to learn how to match my pace to somebody else (or be comfortable being mismatched).
                </p>
                <p>This often leads to a rapid flip of leadership:</p>  

                <p>If I know what I'm doing, what I want to do, I'm frustrated that another can't keep up. I'm fidgeting and annoyed at holding back, 
                    I rush forward to solve all the problems myself first, I anticipate and interrupt conversation to catch it up; 
                    <span class=emph-text>my idea will work, now give me a new problem to solve!</span>
                </p>
                <p>By the same token, once that curiosity and excitement is depleted, or I have nothing enticing to work towards, I'm at risk of falling behind. 
                    <span class=emph-text>I'm irritable, restless, detached</span>. Depleted of passion, I become completely apathetic; 
                    I struggle to make decisions and crave others to precisely direct me.
                </p>
                <p>And no, I've yet to find an in-between. <span class=emph-text>I'm working on it</span>. Sorry.</p>
            
            <h4>At my best, and at my worst.</h4>
                <p>I am inspired by knowing where I need to be, I need to feel like I'm MOVING somewhere. <span class=emph-text>Getting somewhere</span>. 
                    If all my time is being poured into a hole, with <span class=emph-text>no visible return or feedback</span>, self-discipline will only get me so far. 
                    I try all sorts of things to reduce the load on my impaired forebrain for this - sound machines, music, a nearby water bottle, soft things to touch. 
                    I ask from those around me to provide <span class=emph-text>regular check-ins and feedback</span> (even something small) to help keep me where I need to be.
                </p>
                <p><span class=emph-text>I consider it a trade-off</span>. Yes, I benefit from more oversight, especially during 'slow days'. 
                    <span class=emph-text>But my fast days</span>, ohoho... you've seen nothing yet. 
                    Despite appearances at a glance when I'm distracted, I'm a hard worker. Purposeful, efficient. 
                    In the right environment, I can set a <span class=emph-text>brutal, even unsustainable, pace.</span> 
                    In the wrong one, enough discipline will hopefully let me muddle through and break even - but it is miserable, so I'd much rather do everything I can to empower myself. 
                    The <span class=emph-text>less energy I spend fighting myself</span> inside, the more I can direct to my tasks outside, 
                    and <span class=emph-text>the happier and healthier I am.</span></p>
