## DRAFTS

I tried almost all the methods suggested, plus a few of my own â€“ but unfortunately my head comes with me, so my thoughts do, too. I find it extraordinarily difficult to genuinely step away from the problem in a way that allows me to think about it in the background.

At best, it's out of sight, out of mind: then I came back and the problem exists again and is *exactly the same*. (The only time this has actually worked is when I went to bed and then solved it in the morning.)

More typically, it cycles in a repetitive loop in my head, all-consuming. The only thing I've found *really helps* with thought-loops is feeling like I've made any progress (even if I technically haven't).

> e.g: Am I freaking out over something in my personal life? I make an appointment to see my doctor/psychiatrist/counsellor. And *bam!*, just by having reached out to them, my brain sees a solution on the horizon, and calms down. Fretting melts away.

I wonder if the time-blindness is part of that. Time exists in two baskets: now, and not-now. And not-now contains *all* the not-now, jumbled in a basket. Moving in six months? *Oh my god I have to figure out how to plan for that there are so many things I need to get--* Could I do this tomorrow? *Well I don't see how the me in 15 years will be any different aaaaahhhh--*

And PROJECTED futures, and HYPOTHETICAL futures, are each as valid as each other, and neither are as valid as NOW. The way I feel NOW, is how I imagine I will ALWAYS feel. I'm sick? God, I will do anything to not get sick like this again. I'm healthy? Why would I want to do *that* to prevent relapse, I might risk ALL THESE OTHER THINGS--

Do I know it is bullshit? Yes. Can I do anything about it? ...Not enough. I have mindfulness mantras ("That's a hypothetical future, Charlie, of course it feels better/worse. But we are we doing about THIS time?")

Anyway, for problem-solving, it means that if I can't solve my problem now, I feel like I can't solve it at all. Do I know that's bullshit? Logically, sure. Emotionally, good fucking luck, lmao. My emotions and I aren't on speaking terms. Sometimes I can reach a paralysis state where executive function is so bad, I literally can't stand up. I'm sitting in the chair yelling at myself for being unable to do anything other than yell at myself.

I tried literally all of the ones suggested, plus I have my own tricks that help me out such as music, juice, 'rebooting' with a shower, etc.

The one I used the least was asking for help. I don't doubt that having help would be really useful to me, but it was just never available when I needed it. The only person I knew that could answer the same day didn't know much more than I did and wasn't very good at answering my actual question. (They also kept talking about irrelevant coding stuff while I was trying to read - a digital call invites further conversation in a way that sitting nearby in person does not.)

I honestly wish that I was in a class in person, with classmates next to me that could notice my missing braces, with teachers I could call over that would see my misused methods. But I don't. So getting help from other people, despite potentially being undeniably useful, is just far too slow. By the time I hear back from anybody, I've either managed to solve it myself through pure willpower and spite, *or* I've foamed myself up into an irrational frenzy and am incapable of comprehending their help in a meaningful way due to mental fatigue.

And unfortunately, there is no way for me to address the mental fatigue. I can't take breaks while the problem is there; I can't *not* think about the problem. It consumes me. I can't relax, because I'm guilty about the problem. I can't do a different problem, because I'm stuck on thinking about the first one. I can't go for a walk, because I spend the whole time ranting to myself about being stuck on the problem.

The only thing I've found successfully resolves distress from a problem, is resolving the problem itself. And asking for help in an online environment is just. Too. Slow.

I wish that wasn't true. I've so desperately wanted help, so many times. But it just isn't there when I need it, so I continue to tired myself out getting by without it.
