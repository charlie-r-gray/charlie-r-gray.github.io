# NEUROPLASTICITY

## What is neuroplasticity?

'Neuroplasticity' refers to our brain's ability to change, and grow. Adapt, improvise, overcome.

We're well aware of the 'use it or lose it' philosophy on musculature. You want to dead-lift 100 kilos? Start by dead-lifting 20. You want to *keep* dead-lifting 100 kilos? *Don't stop.*

The same is true of most of the rest our being - *physical, emotional, mental.* The things we use get stronger, easier, to the point we don't think about them.

Socialise, and you get more likable and charming. Indulge in anger, and you become more quick-tempered. Overeat when young ("there's starving children out there!") and overfeed yourself as an adult. For good and bad, the road most traveled wears the deepest - 'stuck in a rut'. Your brain's proverbial carriage wheels easily slip into the trails of its previous trips.

## Neuroplasticity in trauma and recovery

This can have its downsides, of course. Depression shows physical damage in the brain, as self-abusing thoughts carve deeper and thicker. Maladaptive habits designed to help cope short-term take root, and become harder and harder to replace.

But there's good news, too: much like the wind wears away old footprints, so too does time fill old forgotten tracks. With enough time and effort, the damage from depression can even heal and reverse. With enough time and effort, we can replace maladaptive habits with healthy ones.

After a traumatic leg injury, physiotherapy and strengthen you enough to walk again. And after a traumatic brain injury, you can relearn to walk, write, and speak with different parts of your brain. Like your leg, they just need the time to train.

Humans generally rely heavily on sight, but without it, your awareness of other senses is heightened. It's not a superpower, to tell where people are in the room feeling their vibrations in the floor, or to 'hear' how sound changes shape as it bounces off of them. To write smoothly with your lips or your toes in the absence of hands.

It's neuroplasticity in action.

## This is your brain on neuroplasticity.

Do you still drive to work like you did when you had a Learner's license? Because I'm willing to bet that driving has become to automatic for you; that if anything, you sat in the driver's seat wondering about what your day will be like. What to have for dinner. What you did yesterday; if you can do better today.

Okay, now how confident do you think you'd be flying a commercial plane - right now, today? Checking altitude, lift, bearing, fuel lines, understanding each dial - and yet, at one point in your life, driving a car took just as much cognitive effort. Now it is intimately familiar.

Or maybe driving isn't familiar to you yet - but is biking? Do you still consciously think about how you turn slightly to the opposite side just before a tight turn, to bring the bike's centrifugal centre under you as you lean in? *Is walking?* Do you take each step haltingly, checking your balance with every step; are you cognisant of 'falling forwards' and catching yourself, over and over? Or is it just 'walking' now?

## What this means for learning:

The great news is that this neuroplasticity never goes away. Even when you're over sixty, it's still there. For a long time we thought that neuroplasticity was a child's skill; that as we aged we just *become*. As smart as we'll be, as cunning as we'll be, as likable as we'll be.

But of course babies learn faster than adults - they're never doing anything else! All they do is learn. You can feel annoyed that you're not learning your chosen language as 'effortlessly' as a bilingual child raised in it - but are you dedicating 8+ hours a day to it? No? *Then what about a child learning language is effortless?* Did you master the fork immediately as a toddler? No? *Then why should you master the chopsticks immediately as an adult?*

We are always capable of learning, as long as we insist on *still trying to learn*.

## The growth mindset

The growth mindset is nothing more complex than the recognition, and celebration, of neuroplasticity. Of 'not yet.'

Fourteen-year-old you doesn't know how to drive... *yet*. Five-year-old you doesn't know how to bike... yet. Two-year-old doesn't know how to use a knife and fork... yet. Infant you doesn't know how to walk... yet.

What don't you know how to do... yet?

The great thing about understanding neuroplasticity - and through that, the growth mindset - is how much more confident and capable you can immediately start becoming. Learned skills, not innate talent.

Under the old fixed mindset of how 'smart' or 'talented' a person is, challenge feels like an upper limit. It's the end of your learning - it's too much, I'm not smart enough to get this, it's not for me. But neuroplasticity proves the opposite - challenge is *the start* of your learning. Challenge is where learning happens! 'Failure' is information-gathering, adversity is experience.

Go forth, embrace challenge. You will not immediately succeed. You will struggle. You will fail. You will stall the engine, you will veer the steering, you will forget to check your mirrors, you will scrape the curb with your tires, you will park crookedly in parallel spaces. *And you will learn to drive.*

# Adopting these strategies

I've actually been thinking along this way, in my own halting degrees, for a few years. It has been a big part of my personal growth, especially in how I conduct myself emotional and practically.

I spent a long time 'accepting' that I was inherently a failure; since all the things I was producing weren't enough, that *I* wasn't enough. Well, a few years ago I woke up to that not having to be the case. 

It's a long hard journey. Like I said earlier in the section about neuroplasticity in trauma, some ruts are worn deep. The carriage wheels slip into them easily.

I did also look up some guides and information on neuroplasticity in those with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular ADHD. My forebrain started developing later (it was noticeable by the time I was three), it developed slower. I'm old enough now that it isn't developing *fundamentally* at all, anymore. But it is still making new connections.

My brain lagged behind in processing emotion and communication autonomously, so I learned to socialise deliberately, and I've been learning to process emotion deliberately, too. It's the slower path, but it is getting me where I need to go.
