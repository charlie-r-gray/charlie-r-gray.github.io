Added the template at the handbook instructed. I also made my own HTML template (not linked to anything), with the goal that once I've established a format I like, I can easily replicate it in any blog pages.

Hello please dispatch a sniper and execute me post-haste.

I have everything on a piece of paper. I know their respective orders. I know what needs to be where. But it keeps doing unintuitive nonsense, and I waste time chasing down how to do the unintuitive thing instead.

I want to make a table cell have a background colour. Set the background colour for the cell's class, right? Hahahahahha that's cute. Nope. That just highlights the text like we're panicking for exams and *everything* is important. Want to fill the cell? Good luck, I still don't know how.

So, yeah, I'm cheating by making the background mimic what I wanted. Which is... fine? for now, but means I can't do like 30% of the things I wanted to do *at all*, because the background is obviously always going to be on the bottom, so I can't have the text """container""" go over the background in any way.

Oh, and for SOME reason, despite using the exact same CSS, the index page has no respect for the footer (that is to say, it ignored it's own margin bottom), but the other page does? NEWFLASH, HTML, IT'S THE SAME CSS. THEY DO THE SAME THING. THEY'RE BOTH ALL THE SAME TAGS!

The thing that pisses me off is that I 'know', objectively, that I've done a lot. But I can't feel happy about it, or satisfied with it, because it's a piss-poor imitation of what I *could have* done. It is a mockery and a shadow.
