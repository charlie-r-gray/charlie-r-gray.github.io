Added the template at the handbook instructed. I also made my own HTML template (not linked to anything), with the goal that once I've established a format I like, I can easily replicate it in any blog pages.

I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing with the README. It can't be commit messages, because I already have that. It can't be a tech blog, because I already have that. It can't be relfections, *because I already have that. It can't be a diary, because I already have that.*

The README is that this is a 'blog', and it doesn't look like what I wanted, and I'm unhappy about that.
